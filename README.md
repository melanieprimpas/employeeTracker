# employeeTracker

## Description
This project was to create an application that tracks employees by departments, and roles. The app connects to a SQL database that includes starter code implemented through a schema.sql file which creates the database and tables, and a seeds.sql file that adds data to the tables. The employee tracker app runs and prompts the user to view, add, update or deleted departments, roles and employees.
